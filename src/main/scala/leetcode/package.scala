/** =Leetcode Solutions in Scala=
  *
  * This project was created with a few purposes
  *
  * First it is to help boost language [[http://scala-lang.org Scala]] and
  * its functional approach to solve problems, Scala is expressive, succinct
  * meanwhile far too much underrated. Second let's just admit one ''cannot''
  * judge the engineering calibers of another in one hour technical interview,
  * I personally have had and failed a few and I want to do something to alleviate
  * this madness of the industry. Use ''Search'' above and type in some method names
  * to get the point ...
  *
  * The listed solutions are by no means complete or optimal, if you would
  * agree the causes, and feel like to contribute solutions, fixes or scaladocs
  * to better illustrate everything, all [[https://github.com/kaiwu/leetcode/pulls PRs]]
  * are welcome !
  *
  * To maintain its goal please take a few notes too,
  *
  *  - Respect Scala [[https://www.scala-lang.org/conduct/ CoC]].
  *  - Solutions shall pass ''all'' of their tests in leetcode, using Scala STD library only.
  *  - Solutions need to bundle their own unit tests, this project uses [[https://github.com/lihaoyi/utest uTest]].
  *  - Always prefer ''functional'' programming, which requires immutable data, pure functions etc,
  *    and keep it to the point.
  *  - Always prefer a generic solution, which captures the gist of a pattern or an algorithm, even if it implies
  *    some tradeoffs and becomes slightly suboptimal in terms of computational or space efficiency.
  *  - Try to achieve performance only after doing it right, iterate above notes for clarification,
  *    although this might defeat the original leetcode intention, one might be surprised that functional
  *    programming can be performant too.
  *  - Extra boilerplates are needed in package object so that [[https://kaiwu.github.io/leetcode/ Scaladoc]]
       can better serve us.
  *  - Last not the least, use [[https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/ Scalafmt]]
