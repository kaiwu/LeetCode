# Leetcode Solutions in Scala #

This project was created with a few purposes

First it is to help boost language [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) and
its functional approach to solve problems, Scala is expressive, succinct
meanwhile far too much underrated. Second let's just admit one `cannot`
judge the engineering calibers of another in one hour technical interview,
I personally have had and failed a few and I want to do something to alleviate
this madness of the industry. Use `Search` from the [scaladoc](https://kaiwu.github.io/leetcode/)
(or in [China](https://www.darkanchor.com/leetcode/index.html)) and type in
some method names to get the point ...

The listed solutions are by no means complete or optimal, if you would
agree the causes, and feel like to contribute solutions, fixes or scaladocs
to better illustrate everything, all [PRs](https://github.com/kaiwu/leetcode/pulls)
are welcome !
